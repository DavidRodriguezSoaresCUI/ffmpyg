# FFMPYG - A FFMPEG interface for Python

A library by me, for my purposes, with goals:

- Powerful: makes it easy to do complex actions
- Transparent: its power shouldn't come at the cost of losing the ability to exploit the full range of features of FFMPEG
- Specific: tailored to my needs (see PlexOptimizer)
- Self-sufficient: uses as little non-built-in libraries as possible
- Documented: has type hints and comments
- Statically tested: using mypy/bandit/pylint/flake8

While I do provide this work under a permissive license, I do not provide any guarantees of any kind, so use it at your own discretion.
